## Abstract

<p style="text-align: justify"> Deep learning is an area of machine learning that is experiencing an enormous development in recent years and whose applications are revolutionizing very diverse domains, including science. This revolution has also reached the field of physics and, among other branches of it, high energy physics. So far, supervised learning models (for regression and classification) have shown great efficiency in massive data analysis. An example of this is the CTLearn project, a library programmed in Python focused on the analysis of images from imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). However, the training of these models, and in general the characterization of the response of IACTs, requires a large volume of labeled data, something that so far is obtained by expensive Monte Carlo simulations. In order to reduce the computational cost and increase the realism of the simulated data, the possibility of replacing such simulations with what is called a generative deep learning model is studied in this project. In particular, the potential of so-called generative adversarial networks or GANs for this purpose is assessed. Using an AC-GANs approach, that is, using an auxiliary model to condition the GANs, the aim is to replicate a set of simulated data from their labels (particle type, energy and arrival direction). The level of realism of the images and their degree of correlation with their labels is evaluated using CTLearn models on a validation data set. As a result, image generation times several orders of magnitude shorter and a promising degree of realism are obtained, but insufficient correlation with the labels, something that could be solved by better tuning of the model configuration. </p>
